## 🎯 Overview

AppFlowy Web requires AppFlowy Cloud as its backend. You can set up this pair in two ways:

- **🛠️ Development Mode** (`dev.env`) - For local development and testing
- **🚀 Production Mode** (`deploy.env`) - For production deployments with Docker

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** ≥18.0.0
- **pnpm** ≥10.9.0  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (required for both modes)

## Prepare the formula package

This fork uses the Rust/WASM `@notion-formula/sdk`. Before the first dependency
install, build the commit pinned in `scripts/notion-formula-source.json`:

```sh
# Requires Git, Node.js 20+, pnpm, Rust with wasm32-unknown-unknown, and wasm-pack.
node scripts/prepare-notion-formula.mjs
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

CI uses Rust 1.95.0 and wasm-pack 0.12.1. Preparation fetches the pinned source
without submodules and copies only the package manifest and `dist` into the
ignored `.notion-formula-sdk` directory. Rust build artifacts are cached in
`.notion-formula-build`. Run preparation again after changing the pin.

For development across both repositories, pass a local notion-formula-rs checkout:
`pnpm formula:prepare /path/to/notion-formula-rs`. When working from its AppFlowy
example submodule, the parent's `just deps-appflowy` already stages the current SDK.

Both Dockerfiles require the prepared SDK in the build context; run preparation
before `docker build`. CI prepares it before dependency installation and Docker
builds, and keys the package cache by the pinned source and preparation scripts.

See [Rust formula integration](NOTION_FORMULA.md) for storage compatibility,
editor behavior, and reproducible browser checks.

## 🛠️ Development Mode Setup

**Best for:** Local development, testing, and debugging individual services.

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Set Up AppFlowy Cloud (Development)

> 💡 **Tip**: The `generate_env.sh` script creates a proper `.env` file with all necessary configurations. Check the [AppFlowy Cloud README](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Cloud/blob/main/README.md) for more details.
```bash
# Clone AppFlowy Cloud repository
git clone https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Cloud.git
cd AppFlowy-Cloud

# Use development configuration
# The `generate_env.sh` script creates a proper `.env` file with all necessary configurations. 
./script/generate_env.sh 

# Start development server
# For new setup - RECOMMENDED FOR FIRST TIME
./script/run_local_server.sh --reset

# Or run (interactive prompts for container management)
./script/run_local_server.sh
```

#### 2. Set Up AppFlowy Web (Development)

```bash
# In a new terminal, navigate to your AppFlowy Web directory
cd /path/to/appflowy-web
cp dev.env .env

# Install dependencies and start
corepack enable
pnpm formula:prepare
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run dev
```

### Hosted plan restrictions

`src/application/workspace-plan-policy.ts` defines the shared abstract
`WorkspacePlanPolicy` and separate hosted, self-hosted, and unresolved implementations.
Select it from the current server-info snapshot; do not infer a deployment from a
workspace's subscription or duplicate hosting checks in feature code.

The subscription hook uses this policy for charts, Timeline, expanded colors,
PDF export, history, namespaces and other paid features. Self-hosted workspaces
receive access without a billing request, even when subscription data is missing
or says Free. Form/Chart creation and conversion only require an online quota
check on hosted deployments. Ordinary creation APIs still await the server's
response on self-hosted deployments; this bypass does not add an offline creation API.

HTTP, upload, and realtime storage error formatters use the same policy for Pro
upgrade guidance. Self-hosted server errors remain visible as sent by the server;
permissions, capabilities, licensing and administrator resource limits are separate
from cloud commercial plan restrictions. Loading or failed server-info never grants
the self-hosted bypass or displays cloud checkout prompts.

### Testing Timeline workspace access

Official production builds disable Timeline creation in non-Pro workspaces and show a Pro-workspace
tooltip in the new-page and database add-view menus. The check uses the current workspace's
subscription; Team and AI add-ons do not qualify. Self-hosted instances are exempt.

Web development/test mode bypasses this client check. To test creation without Pro, also run a
debug Cloud server (`debug_assertions` enabled); a release Cloud server still enforces Pro.
Production-policy tests explicitly disable the development bypass.


## 🚀 Production Mode Setup

**Best for:** Production deployments, staging environments, and containerized setups.


#### 1. Set Up AppFlowy Cloud (Production)

```bash
# Clone AppFlowy Cloud repository
git clone https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Cloud.git
cd AppFlowy-Cloud

# Use production configuration
# The `generate_env.sh` script creates a proper `.env` file with all necessary configurations. 
./script/generate_env.sh 

# Start with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```

#### 2. Set Up AppFlowy Web (Production)

```bash
# In a new terminal, navigate to your AppFlowy Web directory
cd /path/to/appflowy-web

# Use matching production configuration
cp deploy.env .env

# Install dependencies and start
corepack enable
pnpm formula:prepare
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run dev
```

#### Server-side rendering of published pages (optional)

The Docker image can server-render published pages for crawlers. It is **off by
default**: with no configuration, published pages are served exactly as before.
See [Published page SSR](./PUBLISH_SSR.md) for the environment variables
(`APPFLOWY_INDEXABLE_NAMESPACES`, `APPFLOWY_SSR_KILL_SWITCH`, …) and rollout steps.

## Confluence import formats

The Confluence import option accepts single-space HTML and CSV export ZIPs. Choose it from a
page's import dialog to add content below that page, or from **Settings → Manage data → Import**
to create a workspace. Upload the complete export ZIP, including its attachments. The separate
CSV option imports ordinary CSV files as databases.

The web client uploads both export formats through the existing Confluence task APIs. AppFlowy
Cloud detects the archive format and converts the content. CSV exports require the native CSV
importer in [Cloud PR #1188](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Cloud-Premium/pull/1188);
servers with only the HTML importer cannot process CSV exports. Site backup ZIPs are unsupported.

For a real export sample, download XWiki's unmodified
[csv-RJTest.zip](https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/confluence/blob/7e8f8fc4ebd7cb735c233c4c3fa124c45102f9e1/confluence-xml/src/test/resources/confluencexml/csv-RJTest.zip).
The backend fixture test verifies 19 imported documents, page relationships, internal links,
and the current spreadsheet attachment. Web regressions cover selection, drag-and-drop,
Confluence routing, and preserving the original file through single and multipart uploads;
archive decoding is tested by the backend.
